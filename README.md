# Hello, World!
I am a broke high school student, who is not allowed to earn his own money, because of his H-4 visa status in the U.S. This has become a particular cause of concern, as I am unable to buy an HDMI monitor, a USB cable and a USB mouse for the Jetson TX1 board that Mrs. Madra so generously lent me.
Anyway, hello, world! This is Sagni(c)k Bhattacharya.
